# to test it you need a worklet.pcm file.

This file needs to fit the webaudio format :

```
 The buffer contains data in the following format: non-interleaved IEEE754 32-bit linear PCM with a nominal range between -1 and +1, that is, 32bits floating point buffer, with each samples between -1.0 and 1.0. If the AudioBuffer has multiple channels, they are stored in separate buffer.
```

The WebAudio graph (tested on a tot chrome build on macos), shows the AudioBufferSource is connected the way it should be.


Bindings:


```
python3 ~/vlc/emscripten/tools/webidl_binder.py my_dummy.idl glue

emcc test.cpp --bind --post-js glue.js --preload-file . -o out/test.html -s TOTAL_MEMORY=1GB ```
